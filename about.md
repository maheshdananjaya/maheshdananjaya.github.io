<p align="justify">I am a graduate student in computer science at <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. I am affiliated to <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.icsa.informatics.ed.ac.uk/compilers/">Compilers and Architecture Design (CArD)</a> group of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/">Institute of Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</a> at School of  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Informatics</a>. I am also a student of EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism">Pervasive Parallelism</a>.I am currently working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vnagaraj/">Dr.Vijay Nagarajan</a> as my primary supervisor.</p>

<p align="justify"> I am broadly interested in computer architecture, compiler optimizations, with a particular emphasis on parallel computing, memory systems and distributed computing. My current research lies in the areas of providing hardware/software support for <strong>memory consistency models</strong>, <strong>cache coherency</strong> and <strong>persistent memory</strong> with a focus on reducing data movement overheads in modern heterogeneous and memory-centric systems. This is motivated by the current trends in high performance and energy-efficient systems design for compute-intensive and data-intensive applications with emerging workloads.</p> 
 
<p>I was working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</a> and  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.paraqum.com/">Paraqum</a> in Electronic Design Automations (EDA) and ASIC/FPGA designs respectively. Also, I was working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.ent.mrt.ac.lk/~pasqual/">Dr. Ajith Pasqual</a> for my undergraduate reserach thesis, OpenFlow Aware RISC Network Processor.</p>
