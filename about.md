<p align="justify"><strong>I am a masters student in computer science at the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. I am affiliated to <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.icsa.informatics.ed.ac.uk/compilers/">Compilers and Architecture Design (CArD)</a> group of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/">Institute of Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</a> of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/"> Informatics</a>. I am also a part of Center for Doctoral Training in <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism">Pervasive Parallelism</a>. I am advised by <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vnagaraj/">Dr.Vijay Nagarajan</a>.</strong></p>


<p align="justify"><strong> My research focus is on computer architecture, distributed systems and (a little bit of) compilers, with particular emphasis on <b> consistency models</b>, <b>coherence protocols</b> and <b>emerging memory</b>.</strong></p>. This is highly motivated by clamouring needs for building more secure, reliable and verifiable systems.
 
<p align="justify"><strong>I have previously worked with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.ent.mrt.ac.lk/~pasqual/">Dr. Ajith Pasqual</a> on processor architectures and software-defined hardware/networks architectures at the department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. I also worked with few companies including Synopsys (formerly Atrenta), WSO2, Paraqum and Codegen, before moving to Edinburgh. </strong></p>
