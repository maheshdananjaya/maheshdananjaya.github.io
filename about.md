<p align="justify"><strong>I am a graduate student in computer science at <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. I am affiliated to <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.icsa.informatics.ed.ac.uk/compilers/">Compilers and Architecture Design (CArD)</a> group of <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa/">Institute of Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</a> at School of  <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Informatics</a>. I am also a student of Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/cdt/pervasive-parallelism">Pervasive Parallelism</a>. I am currently working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vnagaraj/">Dr.Vijay Nagarajan</a> as my primary supervisor.</strong></p>

<p align="justify"><strong> I am broadly interested in computer architecture, compiler optimizations and memory systems with a particular emphasis on providing hardware/software support for parallel computing systems and emerging memory systems. My current research lies in the areas of <b>memory consistency</b>, <b>memory persistency</b> and <b>cache coherency</b>. This is motivated by the current trends in high performance and energy-efficient systems design for compute-intensive and data-intensive applications with emerging workloads.</strong></p> 
 
<p align="justify"><strong>I was previously working on areas such as microarchitecture, processor architecture, reconfigurable computing, very large scale integrated circuits, application and domain-specific accelerators. Moreover, I was working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.ent.mrt.ac.lk/~pasqual/">Dr. Ajith Pasqual</a> for my undergraduate reserach thesis at Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. I had also been a part of Synopsys, Paraqum and Codegen before I joined Edinburgh. </strong></p>
