<p align="justify"><strong> My research focus is on computer architecture and systems with emphasis on <b> consistency models</b>, <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b>.  This is highly motivated by new trends in building robust, reliable and secute computing systems. </strong></p>
 
<p align="justify"><strong>Previously, I collborated with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.ent.mrt.ac.lk/~pasqual/">Dr. Ajith Pasqual</a> on cutting-edge projects involving processor(CPU) architectures and software-defined hardware/networks architectures at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. Subsequenlty, I held an engineering position at Paraqum technologies -- the (first) sri lankan semiconductor startup company that dr.Pasqual founded. In addiion, before starting my PhD, I also gained sound industry experience working with companies like Synopsys, WSO2 and Codegen. </strong></p>
